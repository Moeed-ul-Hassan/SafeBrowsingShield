You are a senior software engineer tasked with building an online porn blocker web app + browser extension that helps people overcome porn addiction. This blocker should be intelligent, tamper-resistant, and able to detect VPN usage. The tech stack is: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or React), NSFW.js for content classification, and optional Node.js backend.

ðŸ”§ Build these features:
Porn Detection & Blocking

Use a large list of adult keywords/domains to block or redirect.

Detect NSFW content using nsfwjs (TensorFlow.js model).

Automatically blur or remove explicit images from any page.

VPN Detection

Use ipapi.co or similar IP-based services to detect if user is using a VPN.

If VPN is detected, show a full-screen warning and restrict access.

Optionally log these attempts with timestamps.

Motivational Overlay / Redirect

Replace blocked sites with custom motivational page/quote.

Friendly UI that reminds the user of their goal to quit porn.

Password-Protected Settings

Allow user to enable "Strict Mode" that canâ€™t be turned off without a passcode.

Option to lock settings for a time period (e.g., 7-day challenge).

Accountability Mode

User can add an email of an accountability partner.

Log and email them when the user tries to access blocked content or turns off protection.

Platform Deployment

Web App: Deploy on Vercel/Netlify.

Chrome Extension: Build with manifest v3, background + content scripts.

ðŸ§  Advanced Ideas (Optional for V2):
Auto-update domain/block list from cloud

User progress dashboard (days clean, attempts)

Schedule-based blocking (e.g., work hours)

Voice-based motivation (AI-powered)

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
"Build a clean, motivating, and intelligent online porn blocker to help people fight addiction. It should detect VPN usage, filter explicit content using AI, protect settings with passwords, and optionally log/report activity to accountability partners. The UI should be minimal, peaceful, and mobile-friendly.
